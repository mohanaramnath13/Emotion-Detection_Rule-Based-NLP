## Problem Statement:
#### In this project, we are trying to map sentences to a fixed set of five emojis that represent distinct emotions: happy (😊), sad (😔), disgust (🤢), fear (😨), and anger (😠).  

## Question: Why was this particular problem statement chosen? 
#### Answer: This is especially relevant in today’s fast paced lifestyle with social media usage skyrocketing. It helps bridge emotional tone in digital conversations where facial expressions or voice tone are missing, making it easier for people to communicate.

## Methods Implemented:
#### 1. Lexicon-Based Sliding Window with Beam Search 
#### 2. Parse Tree and Weighted Lexicon Matching
